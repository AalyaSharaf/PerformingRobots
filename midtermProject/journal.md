### Brainstorming Project Ideas:

This is the first day that I am working on this project, so I decided to start off with a simple brainstorm. These are just a few of the ideas that came to mind, but I am not too sure that they are the ideas that I am going to stick with...

I unfortunately did not have much time over the weekend to work on the physical aspect of the project, but I was able to narrow down my idea to just one. What I want to have is four buttons, each of which correspond to a sequence of movements within my robot. A sequence could include an arm rotating a certain direction, or maybe even a "dance" sequence of sorts. I also want to include sound in my project, if possible, as I am not too sure how that could be incorporated.
