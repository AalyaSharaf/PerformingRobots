### Brainstorming Project Ideas:

This is the first day that I am working on this project, so I decided to start off with a simple brainstorm. These are just a few of the ideas that came to mind, but I am not too sure that they are the ideas that I am going to stick with...

I unfortunately did not have much time over the weekend to work on the physical aspect of the project, but I was able to narrow down my idea to just one. What I want to have is four buttons, each of which correspond to a sequence of movements within my robot. A sequence could include an arm rotating a certain direction, or maybe even a "dance" sequence of sorts. I also want to include sound in my project, if possible, as I am not too sure how that could be incorporated.

I started to more specifically plan what parts I wanted to use in my project (things like what motors I want to use...) and I created a more "visual" idea of what I want my project to look at. I decided on a few motors with wheels attached in order to have a mobile robot. I also relaly like the idea of having a neoPixel that kind of gives the robot the illusion of life with all the flashy and vibrant colors of the light. Another idea I had was an external remote control using the joystick. We did not really go over it in class but hopefully coding it isn ot too complicated. Drawing was never my strong suit but below are a few sketches I had. Be warned, it gets a bit messy...

Besides that, I started working on the seperate components and seeing if they worked individually, but I was not able to wire and code them together yet. I feel like that is where it is going to start getting cmplicated... I am also still trying to figure out how I am going to assemble all the components in a way that allows it to work the most effeciently. Another concern I had was whether or not I am going to be able to fit all of the components onto one arduino... Hopefully after a bit of experimentation, all will be cleared up.
