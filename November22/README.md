### Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs - Reimagined

The different characters and their roles:
1. Snow White - 
2. Prince
3. Doc - He is the self proclaimed leader of the group.  He is bossy and a bit absent minded but very lovable. He gets tongue tied and looses his train of thought in mid sentences. That could be expressed with a robot that has a head that is constantly looking from left to right, to relay the slight era if confusion that the character exudes. 
4. Grumpy -  He’s grouchy, overbearing  and has a short fuse but deep down he possesses a warm heart. Maybe a robot that is quick to get mad if something were to go wring. For example, if another robot bumps into it, you see him suddenly speeding up and forcefully run into him. That way it could express its anger...
5. Bashful - Shy and always blushing, Bashful likes to hide behind his beard when feeling embarrassed. Could have a robot that is always looking down? To show that kind of shyness, or maybe ones that strays away from other robots he is unfamiliar with...
6. Sleepy - Always yawning and looking for a chance to catch a few winks anywhere he can, Sleepy demonstrates a laid back and relaxed personality. Maybe we can have one that just randomly stops moving or talking and looks like they are falling asleep. Or maybe the head just randomly and quickly drops doen from an upright position?
7. Happy - Happy always has a smile on his face. For this, the first thing that comes to mind is a robot that is constantly energetic, and I feel the best way to relay that is to have it constantly dancing...
8. Sneezy - He speaks with a tone of having a stuffy nose and will erupt in uncontrollable bouts of sneezing at different times. I am not really sure how that would be relayed...
9. Dopey - Dopey doesn’t ever speak in the film.  He is the most loved of all the dwarfs and he gets his name because of his silly antics... I am not quite sure how this would be realyed either...
