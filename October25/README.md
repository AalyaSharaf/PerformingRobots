# Robot Acting Scenario

We are living in a world that is very technologically advanced, and we see this technology being applied everywhere around us. Whether in a scientific manner, or simply in our day to day life, it has something we have adapted to and come to accept. With that being said, what would a robot look like in an artisitc & theatrical scene. With robots, I feel like there is an association that they can only be used to perform specific tasks. With those specific ideas, I wonder how the idea of a robot, designed to specifically act, would play out. 

One of the main things that makes acting so unique is the ability to portray emotions so vividly and clearly to an audience. Essentially, you are adopting a persona that may not be yours, and you are convincing an audience that it is who you truly are. Emotions and robots. To be completely honest, the two seem like contradictory topics. How does a piece of metal convey emotions? But that is where you are wrong; in the limited way in which you precieve robots. So, how would this robot look like? How would they properly be able to convery the emotions that are imperative to a theatrical performance. I believe the answer varies greatly depending on the situation. For example, if this was a movie production, where

The best way to imagine such a situation, is to hypothesize what it would look like if we replaced the human with the robot. When I think of a play, my first and immediate thought is Macbeth by Shakespeare. In this specific instance, I think of the three witches. They are these dark and mythical supernatural creatues, that deliver prophecies, so overall they play an important role in the storyline. What would it look like if these characters were robots? Will the charactersitics that are unique to them vanish? Will it still be interpreted the same way by the audience? What would this robot actor even look like?

Before we get into the intricacies of an audience reaction, we must imagine what this robot would even look like? How would we even build this hypothetical robot actor? In order to figure out how we must build the robot, it is imperative that we establish what technical features this robot may need.
