## Reading Response/Thoughts

##### This is just my thought process while reading this passage, may not be the most organized or make the most sense...


"Several studies have been dedicated to the effects of robot appearance on humans." -> intereting how even with robots, we could have biases and ideals of looks... What constitues as beauty, soemthing that women struggle with a lot on out current society, still also somehow applies to robots.

"On the one hand, it is relatively constrained, be it by script, by score, or by set design thus limiting the perception and actuation expectations of a robotic system. On the other hand, it can provide for a rich environment in which a robotic agent meshes its actions with a human partner, incorporating dialogue, sensory processing, ..." -> I really appreacited how they showed both sides of this perspective... both the pros and the cons of putting robots in such a theatrical context. As a continuation, also about pros and cons, it talks about the strenghts and weaknesses of a robot in such a situation. I also liked the creative and somewhat realistic approach of thinking about how the robot would be coded or programmed to act in such a situation. How would they recieve their input and cues? How are they supposed to know how to react? All important factors that I like are being considered. 

"As for robots used in musical performances, much of the research focuses on sound production, and does not address interactive aspects of musicianship." -> This reminds me of another class I am taking this semester (A.rt I.ntel with Professor Michael Ang), where we discussed machine learning & sound is a field is not as developed in comparison to other topics such as images, art, or even text. I just find it interesting that even in a robots, or specifically robots in a theatrical space, that is also something that is something that is also translated. The author does later go on to explain how it has developed in terms of robot improv, and that is something I personally find quite interesting.
