## Reading Response/Thoughts

##### This is just my thought process while reading this passage, may not be the most organized...


"Several studies have been dedicated to the effects of robot appearance on humans." -> interesting how even with robots, we could have biases and ideals regarding looks... Yes, those ideals may come from a different foundation or basis, but the concpet of what constitues as beauty, or what constitues as "acceptable", still also somehow applies to robots.

"On the one hand, it is relatively constrained, be it by script, by score, or by set design thus limiting the perception and actuation expectations of a robotic system. On the other hand, it can provide for a rich environment in which a robotic agent meshes its actions with a human partner, incorporating dialogue, sensory processing, ..." -> I really appreciated how they showed both sides of this perspective... both the pros and the cons of putting robots in such a theatrical context. As a continuation, it talks about the strenghts and weaknesses of a robot in such a situation. I also liked the creative and somewhat realistic approach of thinking about how the robot would be coded or programmed to act in such a situation. How would they recieve their input and cues? How are they supposed to know how to react? All important factors that I appreciate are being considered. 

"As for robots used in musical performances, much of the research focuses on sound production, and does not address interactive aspects of musicianship." -> This reminds me of another class I am taking this semester (A.rt I.ntel with Professor Michael Ang), where we discussed how machine learning & sound is a field that is not as developed in comparison to other topics such as images, art, or even text. I just find it interesting that even in a robots, or specifically robots in a theatrical space, that is also something that could be translated. The author does later go on to clarify and explain the advancements rbots have made in a muscial setting. Examples of how, recently, robots can improvise and develop their own music, depending on the input surrounding them, and that is something I personally find quite interesting. 

## Robot Play

To be completely honest, I could not really come up with a specific play, or scene from a play, that I particularly gravitated to, so I decided to come up with my own... The idea I came up with, is one of a musical robot. The plot would include something along the lines of this robot trying to make it in the music world, but not bring given the attention that it deserves, simply because it is a robot. The play will then navigate through those challenges with the robot, as it tries to fulfill its one and oly dream of being a superstar. When it comes to actualy characteristics of the robot, I imagine it to be one with strong performance qualities. This means that it will not only be able to play instruments, or sing songs, but it will also know how to dance and work the crowd. These are just a few basic and starter idea that came to mind, and hopefully I will be able to elaborate on them a bit more later on!
